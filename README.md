Hello, I'm a technology-driven leader with a passion for data and dogs. With a background in Finance, Business Administration, and Data Analytics, I bring over seven years of hands-on experience as an individual investor in the Vietnamese stock market, in addition to over a year of experience as an Investment Banking Analyst. Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Commerce and Economic Development with a concentration in Data Analytics. Here is my project related to the stock market, which is one of my favorite topics to discuss. The purpose of the project is to calculate and compare the profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.
